# You don't donate, you don't benefit
The cPanel license is offered 100% free of charge, but to support this project, VPS servers, dedicated servers, virtual networks and technical support, a minimum donation of 2 euros/month is required for each license.
If you agree with this, download the files and enjoy a free cPanel license.
